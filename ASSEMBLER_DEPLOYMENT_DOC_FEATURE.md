# Assembler Agent - Deployment Document Display Feature

## Overview
Enhanced the Assembler Agent to display the full deployment document (markdown) in the Activity Log, similar to how the Planner Agent displays subtasks.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes

#### `graph/assembler_graph.py`
- **Added** `markdown` field to `AssemblerState` TypedDict
- **Modified** `_generate_document_node()` to include markdown content in the return state
- This ensures the markdown content flows through the graph workflow

#### `agents/assembler_agent.py`
- **Updated** `create_deployment_document()` method to:
  - Initialize `markdown=None` in the initial state
  - Return markdown content in the result dictionary alongside deployment_document
- Now returns: `{"success": True, "deployment_document": {...}, "markdown": "...", "tokens_used": ...}`

#### `core/graph_nodes.py`
- **Enhanced** `node_assemble_document()` to:
  - Extract markdown content from assembler result: `markdown_content = assemble_result.get("markdown", "")`
  - Log the full deployment document to Activity Log when markdown is available
  - Added new activity log entry with `"deploymentDocument": markdown_content`
  - Fallback to document sections if markdown is not available
  - Improved activity log structure for better UI display

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### `Agentic_UI/src/types/dashboard.ts`
- **Added** `deploymentDocument?: string` field to `ActivityLog` interface
- This allows the TypeScript frontend to recognize and handle the deployment document data

#### `Agentic_UI/src/components/ActivityLog.tsx`
- **Added** `hasDeploymentDocument` check to detect when deployment document is present
- **Implemented** full deployment document display section:
  - Beautiful green-themed card with gradient background
  - Scrollable container (max-height: 96) for long documents
  - Pre-formatted text with monospace font to preserve markdown formatting
  - Displays before subtasks and document sections (priority display)
  - Shows a "Deployment Document" badge in the activity item header
- **Styled** with Tailwind CSS classes for professional appearance

## How It Works

### Workflow
1. **Assembler Agent generates deployment document** â†’ Creates both JSON and Markdown versions
2. **Markdown content stored locally** â†’ Saved to `deployment_documents/{ISSUE_KEY}.md`
3. **Markdown content returned to graph** â†’ Included in the assembler result
4. **Activity Log updated** â†’ New log entry with `deploymentDocument` field containing full markdown
5. **UI displays the document** â†’ Rendered in a scrollable, formatted container

### Activity Log Display
When the Assembler Agent completes processing:
- Shows "Deployment Document Generated" action
- Displays a green badge indicating "Deployment Document" is available
- Renders the full markdown content in a beautifully formatted card:
  - Green gradient background
  - White content area with border
  - Scrollable if content exceeds max height
  - Monospace font preserves formatting
  - Pre-wrapped text maintains line breaks

## Visual Design
The deployment document display features:
- ðŸŽ¨ **Green theme** to match success status and differentiate from planner subtasks (blue)
- ðŸ“„ **FileText icon** for visual identification
- ðŸ“¦ **Bordered card** with shadow for depth
- ðŸ“œ **Scrollable content** for long documents (max-height: 384px)
- ðŸ”¤ **Monospace font** to preserve markdown formatting
- âœ¨ **Gradient background** for professional appearance

## Example Activity Log Entry

```json
{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-13T10:30:00Z",
  "agent": "AssemblerAgent",
  "action": "Deployment Document Generated",
  "details": "Deployment document successfully generated for BC-123",
  "status": "success",
  "issueId": "BC-123",
  "deploymentDocument": "# Deployment Document\n\n## Project Overview\n..."
}
```

## Benefits
1. âœ… **Complete visibility** - Users can see the full deployment document directly in the Activity Log
2. âœ… **Similar to Planner** - Consistent UX with how Planner shows subtasks
3. âœ… **No extra clicks** - Document displayed inline, no need to open external files
4. âœ… **Real-time feedback** - See the document as soon as Assembler Agent completes
5. âœ… **Better debugging** - Easier to verify what the Assembler Agent generated
6. âœ… **Professional UI** - Beautiful, scrollable display with proper formatting

## Testing
To test this feature:
1. Start the system and trigger a workflow with a JIRA issue
2. Wait for the Assembler Agent to process the issue
3. Check the Activity Log in the UI Dashboard
4. Look for the "Deployment Document Generated" entry with green badge
5. The full deployment document should be displayed in a green-themed card
6. Scroll through the content if it's long

## Files Modified
- `graph/assembler_graph.py` - Added markdown to state
- `agents/assembler_agent.py` - Return markdown in result
- `core/graph_nodes.py` - Log deployment document to activity
- `Agentic_UI/src/types/dashboard.ts` - Added deploymentDocument type
- `Agentic_UI/src/components/ActivityLog.tsx` - Display deployment document

## Notes
- The markdown content is already generated by `tools/assembler_tool.py` (no changes needed there)
- The document is saved locally in `deployment_documents/{ISSUE_KEY}.md` for reference
- The UI prioritizes showing the full deployment document over document sections
- If markdown is not available, falls back to showing document sections as before
