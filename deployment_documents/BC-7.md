# Deployment Document for TRD-001

## Metadata
- **Issue Key:** TRD-001  
- **Summary:** Energy trading / market optimization  
- **Created At:** 2025-10-13T12:00:00Z  
- **Version:** 1.0  

## Project Overview
- **Description:**  
  A comprehensive platform for real‑time energy trading and market optimization, integrating market, weather, and demand‑response data to forecast prices and optimize bidding and storage decisions.  
- **Project Type:** Energy Trading Platform  
- **Architecture:**  
  - Data ingestion pipelines (real‑time)  
  - Forecasting microservice (high‑accuracy price model)  
  - Trading logic microservice (LP‑based bidding optimizer & storage engine)  
  - Unified decision engine with REST API  
  - Monitoring & alerting stack (dashboards, thresholds)  

## Implementation Plan

### Subtasks
- Establish a robust data foundation and compliance framework: Build real‑time ingestion pipelines for market, weather, and DR data; develop a high‑accuracy price forecasting model; implement risk and compliance checks; and create comprehensive unit tests to validate each component.  
- Design and validate core trading logic: Implement a linear‑programming based bidding optimizer and a storage decision engine that use forecasted prices and system state; perform end‑to‑end integration testing in a simulated market environment to ensure correct interaction among modules.  
- Integrate, deploy, and monitor the trading platform: Combine all modules into a unified decision engine with a clean API; deploy to staging; set up monitoring dashboards (bid success rate, forecast error, storage utilization) and alert thresholds.  

### Execution Order
1. Establish a robust data foundation and compliance framework  
2. Design and validate core trading logic  
3. Integrate, deploy, and monitor the trading platform  

### Dependencies
- **Subtask 2:** Requires completion of Subtask 1  
- **Subtask 3:** Requires completion of Subtask 2  

### Parallel Groups
- None – all subtasks are sequential  

### Critical Path
- Subtask 1 → Subtask 2 → Subtask 3

## Technical Specifications

### main.py
- **Imports:**  
  - `import config`  
  - `import logging`  
- **Classes:**  
  - `class TradingEngine:` – orchestrates data ingestion, forecasting, and bidding logic.  
- **Functions:**  
  - `def run():` – entry point that initializes the engine and starts the event loop.  
- **Data Structures:**  
  - `dict market_data` – holds real‑time market feeds.  
  - `dict forecast` – stores price predictions.  
  - `dict bids` – tracks submitted bids.  
- **Logic Flows:**  
  1. Load configuration.  
  2. Initialize data ingestion pipelines.  
  3. Run forecasting model.  
  4. Generate bids via LP optimizer.  
  5. Submit bids to market simulator.  
  6. Log results and update dashboards.  
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Try/except blocks around external API calls.  
  - Validation checks for data integrity.  
- **Connections:**  
  - Connects to market data stream, weather API, DR data source, and storage system.  

## Deployment Instructions

### Setup
- Install Python 3.12 and required packages (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).  
- Configure environment variables (see below).  

### Build
- No build step required for Python scripts.  

### Run
- `python main.py`  

### Environment Variables
- `MARKET_API_KEY` – API key for market data provider.  
- `WEATHER_API_KEY` – API key for weather data provider.  
- `DR_API_KEY` – API key for demand‑response data.  
- `LOG_LEVEL` – Logging verbosity (e.g., INFO, DEBUG).  

### Testing
- Run unit tests: `pytest tests/`  
- Perform integration test in simulated market: `python tests/integration_test.py`
