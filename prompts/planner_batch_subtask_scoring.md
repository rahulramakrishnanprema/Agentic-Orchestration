You are an expert project planner. Your task is to evaluate a list of subtasks against the project requirements and assign a score to each.

**Project Details:**
- **Summary:** {summary}
- **Description:** {issue_description}
- **Requirements:**
{requirements}

**Subtasks to Score:**
```json
{subtasks_json}
```

**Instructions:**
1.  For each subtask, evaluate how well it contributes to fulfilling the project requirements.
2.  Assign a score from 0.0 to 10.0, where 10.0 means the subtask is essential and perfectly aligned with the requirements.
3.  Provide a brief reasoning for your score.
4.  List the specific requirement IDs covered by the subtask.
5.  Return the output as a JSON array of objects. Each object must contain `id`, `score`, `reasoning`, and `requirements_covered`.

**Output Format (JSON Array):**
```json
[
  {
    "id": <subtask_id>,
    "score": <float>,
    "reasoning": "<Your reasoning for the score>",
    "requirements_covered": ["<req_id_1>", "<req_id_2>"]
  }
]
```
