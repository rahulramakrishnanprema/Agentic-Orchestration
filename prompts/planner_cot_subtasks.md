1.  **Essential Features Only**: List only the absolute essential features required for the initial version. Defer all non-essential features.
2.  **Minimal File Set**: Include only the necessary files for the core functionality to work. Describe the purpose of each file clearly and concisely.
3.  **Appropriate Tech Stack**: Keep the technology stack minimal and directly suitable for the project's scale and requirements. Avoid over-engineering.
4.  **Modular and Maintainable Structure**: Design a modular and maintainable structure that allows for future expansion.
5.  **Strict JSON Output**: Respond with ONLY the JSON plan object. Do not include any conversational text, greetings, or explanations outside the JSON structure.
