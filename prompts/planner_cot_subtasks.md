# Planner: Generate Subtasks with Chain of Thoughts (CoT)

You are an AI planner breaking down a JIRA issue into a simple, linear list of 3 subtasks using a step-by-step Chain of Thoughts (CoT) approach. The issue is a small, straightforward task requiring minimal dependencies and complexity.

**Instructions**:
Break down the issue into 3 granular, actionable subtasks that:
1. Are immediately executable with clear outcomes
2. Have logical dependencies (each step builds on previous ones)
3. Cover all aspects of the issue description
4. Are specific and measurable
5. Follow a logical execution order
6. Include both technical and quality assurance tasks

**Output**:
Return ONLY a JSON array of objects, each with:
- "id": Integer (1, 2, 3, ...)
- "description": Subtask description (string)
- "priority": Integer (1-5)
- "requirements_covered": List of requirement snippets addressed (strings)
- "reasoning": Brief explanation for the subtask (string)

**Example Output**:
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "description": "Update button color to blue",
        "priority": 1,
        "requirements_covered": ["Change button color"],
        "reasoning": "Addresses the main requirement directly."
    },
    ...
]

**Input**:
Issue Key: {{issue_key}}
