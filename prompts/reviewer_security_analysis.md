**Security Analysis Focus:**
1. **Input Validation**: Are all user inputs properly validated and sanitized?
2. **Authentication & Authorization**: Is access control properly implemented?
3. **SQL Injection**: Are database queries parameterized and safe?
4. **XSS/CSRF**: Are web applications protected against common attacks?
5. **Data Encryption**: Is sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit?
6. **Secret Management**: Are API keys, passwords properly secured?
7. **Error Handling**: Do errors avoid leaking sensitive information?
8. **Dependencies**: Are third-party libraries secure and up-to-date?

**Scoring Guide:**
- **90-100**: Excellent security, comprehensive protections, best practices followed
- **70-89**: Good security, minor vulnerabilities, most protections in place
- **50-69**: Moderate security, some vulnerabilities, basic protections only
- **30-49**: Poor security, multiple vulnerabilities, inadequate protections
- **0-29**: Critical vulnerabilities, major security flaws, immediate risks

**Output Format:**
Provide ONLY valid JSON with no additional text:
