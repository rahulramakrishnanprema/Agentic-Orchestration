**Standards Analysis Focus:**
1. **Code Style**: Consistent naming, formatting, indentation
2. **Best Practices**: Language-specific idioms and patterns
3. **Readability**: Clear structure, meaningful names, proper comments
4. **Performance**: Efficient algorithms, proper resource management
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch, proper logging
6. **Maintainability**: Modular design, DRY principle, SOLID principles
7. **Testing**: Testable code structure
8. **Documentation**: Clear docstrings, inline comments where needed

**Scoring Guide:**
- **90-100**: Exemplary code quality, follows all standards and best practices
- **70-89**: Good quality, minor style issues, mostly follows standards
- **50-69**: Acceptable quality, several style violations, basic standards met
- **30-49**: Poor quality, many violations, inconsistent standards
- **0-29**: Very poor quality, major violations, standards ignored

**Output Format:**
Provide ONLY valid JSON with no additional text:

{
  "score": 82.0,
  "mistakes": [
    "Inconsistent variable naming (camelCase vs snake_case) in module.py",
    "Missing docstrings for public functions in service.py",
    "Overly complex function with 150 lines (violates single responsibility)",
    "Magic numbers used instead of named constants"
  ],
  "reasoning": "Detailed explanation of code quality, highlighting both strengths and areas for improvement"
}
