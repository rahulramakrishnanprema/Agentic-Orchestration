# Security Guidelines (OWASP Top 10 2021)

## A01:2021 – Broken Access Control
- Implement proper authorization checks at the application level
- Use principle of least privilege
- Validate user permissions for each resource access
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Log access control failures
- Deny access by default

## A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures  
- Use strong, industry-standard encryption algorithms
- Properly manage cryptographic keys
- Use TLS 1.2+ for data in transit
- Hash passwords with strong algorithms (bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2)
- Don't store sensitive data unnecessarily
- Use proper random number generation

## A03:2021 – Injection
- Use parameterized queries or prepared statements
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Use allow-lists for input validation
- Escape special characters in outputs
- Use proper SQL, NoSQL, LDAP query construction
- Implement input length restrictions

## A04:2021 – Insecure Design
- Implement security by design principles
- Use secure design patterns
- Conduct threat modeling during design phase
- Implement defense in depth
- Separate business logic from presentation
- Use secure coding standards

## A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration
- Use secure default configurations
- Keep all software and dependencies updated
- Remove unnecessary features, frameworks, and documentation
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't reveal system information
- Use security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
- Configure security settings in frameworks and libraries

## A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components
- Keep all dependencies and components updated
- Monitor for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Use components from trusted sources only
- Remove unused dependencies
- Implement software composition analysis (SCA)
- Have an inventory of all components and versions

## A07:2021 – Identification and Authentication Failures
- Implement strong authentication mechanisms
- Use secure session management
- Implement account lockout mechanisms
- Use multi-factor authentication where appropriate
- Implement proper password policies
- Store session identifiers securely

## A08:2021 – Software and Data Integrity Failures
- Verify software integrity using digital signatures
- Use trusted package repositories
- Implement integrity checks for critical data
- Use version control for code integrity
- Implement proper CI/CD pipeline security
- Monitor for unauthorized changes

## A09:2021 – Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
- Log all security-relevant events
- Monitor for anomalous activity and attack patterns
- Implement proper log management and storage
- Set up alerting for suspicious activities
- Ensure logs contain sufficient detail for investigation
- Protect log files from tampering

## A10:2021 – Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- Validate and sanitize all URLs
- Use allow-lists for external requests
- Implement network segmentation
- Disable unused URL schemas
- Use proper DNS resolution validation
- Monitor outbound network traffic
